# CSE 341 Lesson 1 Class Activity Steps

- Create a new folder on your computer and open it in VS Code
- Open the terminal and run: npm init
- Go through the CLI prompts to create the package.json
- Whatever filename you chose for your main file (index, app, server, etc.), create that file. For this example, we'll use server.js
- Create an express app that listens on either process.env.port or 3000
- Don't forget to run npm install expresss
- Now is a good time to run npm start, so you can start seeing errors if there are any
- Create a controllers folder with a file called index.js
- Create a single function that will return data
- Create a routes folder with a file called index.js
- Create a single route in that file that will call the function in the controller that you made
- This can all be tested in the browser going to localhost:3000
